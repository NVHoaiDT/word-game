You can play this word-game here: [HDT-Wordle](https://nvhoaidt.github.io/word-game/)

## How to play wordle ?
It works like this: When you visit the site, you're greeted by 6-long grid of empty, white boxes. Each box can hold only one letter, and so you guess at the `answer` by typing in a five-letter word and pressing 'Enter'.

There aren't any clues up front, so first five-letter word will do as an initial guess. That's where the game of Wordle really starts. When you send a guess along, the color of each letter's box changes.

* If it turns <span style="color:#37b24d">*green*</span>, that letter is in the `answer` and you've placed it in the right spot.

* If it turns <span style="color:#ffec99">*yellow*</span>, the letter is in the `answer` but you have it in the wrong position.

* If it turns <span style="color:#868e96">*gray*</span>, it means the letter isn't in the `answer` at all.

Enjoy the game!
